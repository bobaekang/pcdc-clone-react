This is an _incomplete_ clone of [Pediatric Cancer Data Commons website](https://commons.cri.uchicago.edu/) that implements only the appearance of a select set of pages in the original website.

The goal of this excercise is not to create a perfect clone of the original website but to demonstrate the ability to quickly prototype a simple website using React.js.

### Opportunities for improvement

* Accessibility: The current implementation does not take accessibility seriously, failing to add ARIA attributes where needed.
* Asset optimization: E.g. original images are unnecessarily large for web consumption.
* Browser compatibility: The site works as intented on Chrome out of the box, but it may not be the case on other browsers.
* Implementing the rest of the site: Obviously.
* Refactoring: Data can be stored separately, variables can be better renamed, components can be broken down into smaller ones, styles can be better structured, etc.
* Tests: No test is written for the app at the moment.
